## ðŸš€ **FINAL WORKING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Backend âœ… (Already Running)**
Backend is working and fetching news from PubMed on port 5001.

### **Step 2: Fix Frontend Proxy**
The frontend needs to connect to the correct backend port. The proxy has been updated but needs a restart.

**Stop the current frontend** (Ctrl+C) and restart it:

```bash
cd client
unset HOST
BROWSER=none PORT=3001 npm start
```

### **Step 3: Access the Application**
Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3001**

## ðŸ”§ **If You Still See Proxy Errors**

The frontend cache might be holding the old proxy configuration. Try:

```bash
# Clear npm cache and restart
cd client
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
unset HOST
BROWSER=none PORT=3001 npm start
```

---

## ðŸ“Š **Backend Activity Confirmation**

You can see the backend is working because it shows:
```
Fetching news for topics: medicine, radiology, cardiovascular, days back: 7
```

Some sources show 403 errors (normal due to anti-bot protection), but PubMed works perfectly.
